I am a statistician and graduate student of Methodology and statistics at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. My interests include Computational statistics, Data analysis, Data science, Statistical programming, bio-statistics and world governance and leadership. Am enthusiastic with data and computational and open to any conversation about statistics, this could be a collaboration, consultancy or teaching.
